# Project Name

**Author**: Aaron-Jesse
**Version**: 1.1.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application is for a user to look at a book list, read detailed info about a particular book, and add their own if they choose. 

## Getting Started
The user has to navigate to the site URL, no install required as a server handles the requests between the client UI and database.

## Architecture
On the backend this uses express and node for the server, along with pg and cors. Environment variables set with dotenv. The front side uses jquery, pages.js and handlebars for templating.

## Change Log
